# DIY-Drum-Machine

The drum machine has mainly 2 components:
<li>Drum sequencer: made using an arduino Nano with a telephone keypad and 8x16 led matrix display.
<li>Analog Drum voices: 4 drum circuits for Kick, tom, snare and hi-hat.
<hr>
You will need to import the below 3 libraries for the code to compile:
<li>Keypad
<li>LedControl
<li>TimerOne
<hr>
The button mapping will need tweaking since it will depend on the keys you have available in your keypad matrix.<\br>
There is some not so obvious character assignment I have made for my keypad please refer to the comments.
